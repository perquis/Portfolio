# Guideline

In this guideline, you will learn **how to use markdown syntax** to create much more readable and organized documents for this project and **how you can use the custom components** that we have created for you to make your documents more **interactive and user-friendly**.

**Do you feel excited?** If so, Let's get started! ðŸ”¥

## **1. How to get started?**

To begin with, you need to get the knowledge of **the markdown syntax**. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it **can be converted to HTML** and many other formats using a tool by the same name.

If **you are not familiar with markdown**, you can learn it from the following enormous documentation of markdown syntax that it's linked [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). However, if you don't want to go through the whole documentation, you can **watch this video** from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUBNt18RFbo) to get a quick overview of markdown syntax. This a simple tutorial provide you with **the basic knowledge of markdown syntax**. We gave you the second video to show you way of using mdx markdown syntax in the Next.js app.

Remember that if you are familiar with markdown syntax, you can **skip this step** and go to the next section.

## **2. Making the articles by using markdown files**

When you want to **write a new post or project**, you should follow the below structure. This structure is important for the website to render the content correctly.

```mdx
---
title: // Title of the project or post
description: // Description of the project or post
thumbnail_img: // path to the thumbnail image in the public folder, remember to create root directory and add two folders: light and dark to there.
open_graph_img: // path to the opengraph image in the public folder. This the image should be in 1200x630px size.
tags: // Tags in array string format
publishedAt: // Date publication
---
```

The above code block is **the front matter of the markdown file**. It's important to load all necessary information about **thumbnail, seo details and date publication**. Remember to create mdx files in the `/docs/<projects|posts>` folder in the `/<new_name>` and to place there two files with the same name and different extensions: `.pl.mdx` or `.en.mdx`.

Your static assets should be placed in the `/public/static` folder. Remember to create a folder with the name of the project or post and place there all necessary images. The path to the image should be like `/static/<projects|posts>/<light_and_dark>/<name>/<image_name>.png`.

When you have created the front matter, you can start writing the content of the post or project. You can use **markdown syntax** to create much more readable and organized documents. If you want to **learn more about markdown syntax**, you can go to the previous section.

## **3. How to use custom components?**

In this project, we have created **a lot of custom components** that you can use in your markdown files to make them more interactive and user-friendly. You can see all custom components in the **storybook** pages. When you will explore the **storybook**, you can see all components that you can use in your markdown files.

Every component was described with all details about **how to use it** and **what props you can pass** to it. You can see the **code snippet** of the component and **the result of the component**. It's a great way to **learn how to use custom components** in your markdown files.

To use the custom components in your markdown files, you need to only use the **JSX syntax** without any imports ðŸ˜‰.
