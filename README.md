## General info

It was built with **React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS**. Before I started writing code I created a design system using **Figma** and I also created a **Storybook** to **document all the components** I would be using in the project. I used the per domain pattern to structure the project, so it **should be easy to maintain and scale**.

Since 2020, It was my dream to create awesome portfolio page that will showcase my skills and projects. I am happy that I **finally** did it.
